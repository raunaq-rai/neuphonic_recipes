## Team name: CTRL ALT ELITE

### Idea:

As student we often find ourselves in situations where we yet havent been organised enough to go and restock on groceries.
Upon opening our food cupboard, fridge or freezer we often have no idea how are diverse yet sparse array of ingredients can come together to create a tasty and nourishing meal or snack. The average student spends approximately 20 hours per academic year (statistics sampled from our team of 3 members) thinking about what they can make with what they have.

To mitigate this time we have aimed to develop a website which allows a student to tell the website the ingredients they have, and the website outputs a list of possible recipes. This mitagates the need for time consuming research and allows students to spend more time doing other, more pressing activities - while potentialy boosting the student's balanced diet (toast and butter is often not enough)!
